 Raj Pritam More's Marathi film 'Khalid ka Shivaji' had many right-wing groups opposing it . They took issue with the film’s depiction of Shivaji Maharaj as “secular” king and references to a significant Muslim presence in his army . More submitted that the suspension, issued by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on August 7, is arbitrary, illegal, politically motivated and violates his constitutional right to free speech .
