 Hyderabad has a small corner where hands and patience do the work . Timekeeping in Hyderabad still relies on human hands . Customers are mainly the “shaukeens” (collectors) as they say, but stories are slightly different . Owner Punnam Chandra picked up the craft while still in school and never left it . Wahid Watch Company winds them every two days and has done so across generations .
